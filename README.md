### Club37 Case Study

*"The 27 Club is an informal list consisting mostly of popular musicians, artists, actors, and other celebrities who died at age 27."* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/27_Club)

27 Club features, among others, Kurt Cobain, Brian Jones, Amy Winehouse. There is even a [book](https://www.amazon.com/27-History-through-Morrison-Winehouse/dp/0306821680/ref=la_B001IOH9LK_1_1?ascsubtag=___vx__p_8041312__t_w__r_en.wikipedia.org__d_D&s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1415056518&sr=1-1) on this. Big names, sudden deaths. It attracts attention and suggests a mysterious pattern: is it really true that most young rising stars die at 27?

It's not. As [has been shown](https://theconversation.com/the-27-club-is-a-myth-56-is-the-bum-note-for-musicians-33586), most musicians die around 56, which sounds much less mysterious.

Now, there is a similar phenomenon in Russian culture: 37.  
Pushkin, Nekrasov, Nikitin, Gaidar are high profile examples, while Mayakovsky, Odoevsky, Harms died at 36.  

Does club 37 exist or is it an illusion, sparked by few high-profile cases?
